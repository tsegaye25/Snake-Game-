Sound Files for Snake Game
=======================

The game requires two sound files to be placed in the same directory as your executable:

1. eat.wav - A short sound effect played when the snake eats food
2. gameover.wav - A sound effect played when the game ends

You can obtain these sound files in several ways:

Option 1: Download free sound effects
------------------------------------
Visit websites like freesound.org, soundbible.com, or zapsplat.com to download free WAV sound effects.
Search for "eat" or "bite" sounds for eat.wav, and "game over" or "fail" sounds for gameover.wav.

Option 2: Create your own
------------------------
You can use audio editing software like Audacity (free) to create or edit your own sound effects.

Option 3: Use placeholder sounds
------------------------------
If you don't have sound files immediately available, the game will still run, but you won't hear sound effects when eating food or when the game ends.

File Placement
-------------
Place both WAV files in the same directory as your executable, which is typically:
C:\Users\never\Desktop\Snake Game\bin\Debug\

Important: The filenames must be exactly "eat.wav" and "gameover.wav" (all lowercase).
